Project Overview
Encrypted/Secret message was received from intel. Those messages have multiple text files that need to be read and have certain operations performed to get the final message. Helped to decipher a message for time-being.

Learnings from the project
Lots of Python function, such as

1. open(file_name,mode) , to open a file in read mode 
2. write() , to append into the existing file 
3. close() , to close the file 
4. split() , split a message into list of words 
5. lambda function,  one important learning for ME, lambda function can be used within user-defined function. How cool is that!! 
6. filter() , to filter the value of lambda function from a list (in this particular project)
Learnt to comapre two files by selecting the portion we need (through if statement), after converting the message in the file into list.

Approach taken to solve the problem
Message Reading
Created a function to read files, where the path of the file was stored in a variable file_path.

Message Fusion
Extracted one part the secret message from different two files

Message Substitution
Substitute the message of the file for a secret message. Basically, decrypted the secret message.

Message Comparison
Another way to extract message by comparing two files and selecting the portion which is important

Message Filter
Filter the word whose length is even in a message

Message Writing
Combined all the message extracted in the above steps and wrote them into a single file

Challenges faced
One challenge was to figure out which built in functions to use for a particular operation.

For example, comparing or finding difference between two list. It can be done through set function but set in python are unordered which makes the output inconsistent. I googled and found out different methods to comapre two list.
